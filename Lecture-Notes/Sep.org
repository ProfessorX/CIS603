   - We model the world by "Games".
   - Game theory and repeated interactions.
   - Decision making.
   - Social choices and mechanisms.
   - [ ] Just as usual, the project matters.

    - Repetition

    - Communication

    - Knowledge
      - Existence of other players
      - Actions of others
      - Payoffs of others and outsiders

    - Type of games
      - Of conflicting interest
      - Fully cooperative
      - Competitive games: {Constant-sum, Zero-sum}

    - Fictitious play, reinforce learning.

    - The important thing is about the concept. (You have got to
      understand the maths.)

    - Strategy
      - Pure strategy
      - Mixed strategy *maxmin*
      - Val = arg max_{pi_i} min_{pi_-i} r(pi_i,pi_-i)
      - All of them probability distribution

    - yeah the good old linear programming.
      - Dominant strategy. (Actually, because the "revenue" is linear,
        so we can get the MAX at point bala bala.)

      - Rationality. Ref: A beautiful mind. Multi-Agent systems,
        programming and Mathematics.

*** Battle of the Sexes
    - [(4,3), (2,2); (1,1), (3,4)]
    - Strategy:
      - Best response
      - Nash equilibrium
      - Iterative dominance
    - *Optimality?*
      - global or local, it's a question.
      - optimal with respect to what?

    - [(3,1) (0,0.5) (0,0)
    (1,0.5) (1,1)  (5,0)
    (0,1) (4,0.5) (0,0)]
    - *Local Optimal* --> *Global Optimal* Sort of the
      "transformation" of estimation maximization. 
    - Pareto Optimality
      - Pareto dominated (r'_i > r'_(i) && r'_(-i) > r'_(-i)
        (2-dimension, use your mind)

   - is there a strategy that row can use that makes col indifferent
     between its actions.
   - is there a strategy that col can use that makes row indifferent.
