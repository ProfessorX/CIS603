   - We model the world by "Games".
   - Game theory and repeated interactions.
   - Decision making.
   - Social choices and mechanisms.
   - [ ] Just as usual, the project matters.

    - Repetition

    - Communication

    - Knowledge
      - Existence of other players
      - Actions of others
      - Payoffs of others and outsiders

    - Type of games
      - Of conflicting interest
      - Fully cooperative
      - Competitive games: {Constant-sum, Zero-sum}

    - Fictitious play, reinforce learning.

    - The important thing is about the concept. (You have got to
      understand the maths.)

    - Strategy
      - Pure strategy
      - Mixed strategy *maxmin*
      - Val = arg max_{pi_i} min_{pi_-i} r(pi_i,pi_-i)
      - All of them probability distribution

    - yeah the good old linear programming.
      - Dominant strategy. (Actually, because the "revenue" is linear,
        so we can get the MAX at point bala bala.)

      - Rationality. Ref: A beautiful mind. Multi-Agent systems,
        programming and Mathematics.
